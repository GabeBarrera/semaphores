I wrote this code myself.
I believe this code works perfectly in all conditions.

THOUGHT PROCESS
- A semaphore was needed for controlled access to the gym
- Trough trial and error, I determined a semaphore for each kind was needed to control how many of customer type could be in the gym
- In order to determine when to reopen the gym, counter variables for joggers and shooters had to be initialized
